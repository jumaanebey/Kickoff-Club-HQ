# Kickoff Club - Creative Brief for Antigravity

**Project:** Kickoff Club Mobile App
**Date:** December 7, 2025
**Version:** 2.0 - Art Direction Update

---

## Overview

We're pivoting the visual style of Kickoff Club to be more **approachable, cute, and inclusive**. The current assets feel too masculine and aggressive for our target audience. We want a "cozy sports" aesthetic that appeals to a broader demographic, especially female players who might not typically engage with sports games.

---

## The Vision: "Cozy Sports"

**One-liner:** Animal Crossing meets Football

We want players to feel like they're building a **charming team clubhouse**, not a military base. The vibe should be:
- Warm and inviting
- Playful and fun
- Cute without being childish
- Sporty but soft

---

## Target Audience

- Age: 16-35
- Gender: All genders (with particular attention to female appeal)
- Gaming experience: Casual to mid-core
- Comparable audiences: Hay Day, Township, Animal Crossing Pocket Camp players
